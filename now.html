        <h2>What Iâ€™m doing now</h2>

        <p>
            Today I've <a href="https://twitter.com/itsnotaboutlife/status/1587783221793751041" rel="external">decided to stop using Twitter for a month</a> and I figured this might be a good occasion to start the "now page" (even though Derek didn't come up with it as a social media replacement in the first place).
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, no Twitter for me for a month (neither Instagram by the way). Let's see what comes out of this. And let's read more <a href="lists.html#books">books</a> finally!
        </p>

        <h3>Reading</h3>

        <p>
            I was hardly reading anything this year as news were consuming all my spare time, but a couple of weeks back I started getting back on track.

        <p>
            Currently, I'm reading A Thousand Splendid Suns by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini and I really enjoy it!
        </p>

        <h3>Watching</h3>

        <p>
            With daylight saving time end it started to feel more like TV time on cold dark autumn nights, so we signed up for Netflix and started to watch Inventing Anna. Mind-blowing story!
